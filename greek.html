    <h1 class="heading"> History of Greek Cuisine</h1>
    <p class="information">When the first residents settled in Greece, they brought along domestic goods such as grains, while also bringing animals lilke sheep and goats which they adopted. Many Greeks durng the time brought their own cattle and they had an abundance of honey as well. Many different types of crops and other items that were found were being cultivated by the people living in Greece during the time. Many discovered grapes which then led to the production of wine and they also discovered berries and olives to make olive oil. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="information">Overtime, many other groups were entering Greece helping to expand and culturally influence the country. They used the foods that new groups brought to the country to add to their culture. Through these many new groups, the Greeks had invented bread and cultivated new items such as fruit and trees, and animals such as goats, sheep, and cows. With their cultural and food expansion, they were able to have a great amount of vegetables and new crops enhancing new dishes.<p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="information">Through the end of the development of the Greek Cusine, the Greeks were able to bring their new culture and cuisine into new regions and countries in order to expand. As a result of this, many Romans specifically were greatly inspired by their newly produced culture. With the expansion of the Greek culture, they were able to influence other parts of the world. Since the Greeks were able to expand so much thousands of years ago, it is the reason that their famous foods are still eaten and known today. </p>
