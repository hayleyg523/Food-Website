    <hr>
    <h1 class="heading">Background</h1>
    <p class="information">Italian Cuisine has developed and changed back from thousands of years ago. It has influenced many types of cultures overtime. The beginning of this cuisine had started in ancient Rome during the time of the creation of the Roman Empire. As many new people were discovering new items and spices from new lands, they were now brought into their cuisine. Foods that were common in the beginning were wine, vegetables, cheeses, etc. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="information">When this cuisine had developed towards the late 1800's to 1900's there were new groups that had entered the empire bringing in new ideas. These groups were able to influence the initial citizens first living in the empire. As it was common to travel by sea during this time, there were many new cooking techniques being shown and developed in order to keep food from rotting for a long period of time. With religion also playing a major role in cuisine, it helped to incorporate new more common foods we see today such as fish, bread, cheese, eggs, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="information">At the latest point in the development of the Italian cuisine, different parts of different geographical areas in the peninsula had their own known foods that combined to form its cuisine. With this, the cuisine now has a variety of ingridients and flavors that are its foundation. After finally becoming fully developed, this popular cuisine has spread to almost all countries in the world and has greatly impacted many areas with its cultural influence. </p>
